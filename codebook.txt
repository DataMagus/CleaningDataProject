Codebook for the Human Activity Recognizion Tidy Set project data

This codebook provides information for a data set derived from the data set in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The original data set corresponds to measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the dataset from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. For the project, the average of each variable was calculated for each subject and each activity and summarized in a tidy data set. 


The records in the tidy data set have the following format:

  subject activity     feature label feature value
1       1   LAYING mean_tBodyAcc-mean()-X    0.22159824
2       1   LAYING mean_tBodyAcc-mean()-Y   -0.04051395
3       1   LAYING mean_tBodyAcc-mean()-Z   -0.11320355
...    ...  ...                          ...

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

- In this format, the columns correspond to:

- subject: an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Identifiers range from 1 to 30.

- activity: Activity label of the activity conducted by the subject. Activity labels are: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING

- feature label: a description of the feature reported. A detailed description is provided below.

- feature value: value of the corresponding feature label.  Acceleration is reported in m/s^2 (meters/second/second).  Speed measured by gyroscpe is reported in m/s (meters/second).

- Feature label descriptions:
