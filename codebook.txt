Codebook for the Human Activity Recognizion Tidy Set project data

This codebook provides information for a data set derived from the data set in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data set corresponds to only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the dataset from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip The average of each variable was calculated for each subject and each activity. 

The records in the tidy data set have the following format

  subject activity     feature label feature value
1       1   LAYING tBodyAcc-mean()-X    0.22159824
2       1   LAYING tBodyAcc-mean()-Y   -0.04051395
3       1   LAYING tBodyAcc-mean()-Z   -0.11320355
...    ...  ...                          ...

In this format, the columns correspond to:

subject: an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Identifiers range from 1 to 30.

activity: Activity label of the activity conducted by the subject. Activity labels are: 
WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING

feature label: a description of the feature reported. A detailed description is provided below.

feature value: value of the corresponding feature label.  Acceleration is reported in m/s^2 (meters/second/second).  Speed measured by gyroscpe is reported in m/s (meters/second).
